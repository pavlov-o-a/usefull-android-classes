# usefull-android-classes
a bunch of usefull android classes, utilities, etc. which i dont want to loose so i will keep them here

1. DragLayout behave like player in google music app. can scroll to miniplayer and unwrap to whole screen. it can host only one child scrollView so if unwraped,  player can scroll down.
2. SwipeDeleteLayout is substitution of ItemTouchHelper for RecyclerView. The only disadv of this approach is that you should put it in every view of every viewholder.
